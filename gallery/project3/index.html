            <h3 class="k-fancy-title">National Reading Panel</h3>
            <p>In 1997, Congress asked the NICHD, through its Child Development and Behavior Branch, to work with the U.S. 
                Department of Education (ED) in establishing a National Reading Panel that would evaluate existing research and 
                evidence to find the best ways of teaching children to read. <br/>

                The 14-member Panel included members from different backgrounds, including school administrators, working teachers, and scientists 
                involved in reading research. <br/>

                On April 13, 2000, the National Reading Panel concluded its work and submitted its final reports. The Panel has not been reconvened 
                since that time and does not continue to work on this issue. </p>
